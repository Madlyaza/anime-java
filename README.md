## User Guide for setup
This is the user guide for setting up the API and front end consuming program.
For the purposes of keeping this installation simple we are going to assume you have intellij installed. If not refer to their website for more information and guidance on how to install it.

### 1.1 Cloning the repository
First you must clone or download the repository, you can save the code wherever you would like we suggest you put it in an empty folder to not create unforeseen problems.

### 1.2 Install Java
Make sure that Java is installed on your mahcine and updated since we will need ti for the next step, if not you can find downloads [here](https://www.java.com/nl/download/manual.jsp).

I use [Tomcat 9.0.56](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi) as a means of running the API, it is required for running the API.
